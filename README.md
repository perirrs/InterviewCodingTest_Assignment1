I have considered double instead of int , given the algorithm results are shown in decimals and for accurate calculations ( i understand the additional memory / size and happy to redo the code if there are any memory constraints )

Program.cs  had the Main method 

Helper.cs contains all global fileds and properties 

Algorithms.cs has different algorithms and currentl have one for BMI

My Middle name is Sujith in case you see who published this code.
